<!-- 

Tell us something you learned about Bitcoin this week!
Report any issues you had with the guide, ask questions or start a discussion.

Some of the guides ask you to learn something on your own, how did that go?
If you were able to answer any of the extra questions or solve the extra challenges in the guides, report here how that went.

Also please feedback about the guides themselves! Was this week too hard? Too easy? Should the guide include extra details about some topic?
